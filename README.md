*Name: Adolfo Custidiano*

I have implemeneted two endpoints from the API, list and create.
Wrote the unit that I considered pertinent.
I have generated a docker image that run all the tests.

*Missing Things*:
- Integration test to run against the container.
- Separate list and create in different go files.
- Both methods looks the same. there is way for improvements to have a common function and generalize and simplify the code.
